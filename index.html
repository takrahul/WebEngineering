    <h2>Data Science</h2>
    <p class="firstpara">
        The aspect of data science is all about uncovering findings from data. Diving in at a granular level to mine and understand complex behaviors, trends, and inferences. It's about surfacing hidden insight that can help enable companies to make smarter business decisions. For example:

    <h4>How do data scientists mine out insights?</h4>
    <p>It starts with data exploration. When given a challenging question, data scientists become detectives. They investigate leads and try to understand pattern or characteristics within the data. 
       This requires a big dose of analytical creativity.

    <p class="paratwo"> Then as needed, data scientists may apply quantitative technique in order to get a level deeper â€“ e.g. inferential models, segmentation analysis, time series forecasting, synthetic control experiments, etc. The intent is to scientifically piece together a forensic view of what the data is really saying.

       This data-driven insight is central to providing strategic guidance. In this sense, data scientists act as consultants, guiding business stakeholders on how to act on findings.

    This is different from the "data insights" section above, where the outcome to that is to perhaps provide advice to an executive to make a smarter business decision. 
    In contrast, a data product is technical functionality that encapsulates an algorithm, and is designed to integrate directly into core applications. Respective examples of applications that incorporate data product behind the scenes: Amazon's homepage, Gmail's inbox, and autonomous driving software.

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <h3>Why do we need AI?</h3>
    <p>At a very high level artificial intelligence can be split into two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.
    Narrow AI is what we see all around us in computers today: intelligent systems that have been taught or learned how to 
    carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.
    </p>
          
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>This type of machine intelligence is evident in the speech and language recognition of the Siri virtual assistant on the Apple iPhone</li>
        <li>In the vision-recognition systems on self-driving cars, in the recommendation engines that suggest products you might like based on what you</li>
        <li>Unlike humans, these systems can only learn or be taught how to do specific tasks, which is why they are called narrow AI.</li>
    </ul>
